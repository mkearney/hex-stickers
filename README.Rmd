# hex-stickers

A repo for my hex stickers. You can find all the [code used to create the hex logos](code.R) 
as well as the [PNG](PNG) versions (eventually I'll fix the SVG versions).

I use these stickers for my R packages and for [my personal website](https://mikewk.com).

## Icons

These stickers use [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons. To use these icons on your local machine, [download a copy of the icons](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-desktop/setup/getting-started) and install the [three] *`.otf`* font files.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
list.files("PNG") %>% 
  sprintf("<p align='center'> <img src='PNG/%s' width='200px' /> </p>", .) %>%
  paste(collapse = "\n\n") %>% 
  cat(fill = TRUE)
```
